# icinga2-docker

This repository contains a (quasi-)modular image of the Icinga2 monitor systems, orchestrated by docker-compose; to ensures portability through different versions of containers, it uses permanent volumes for storage of config files and data.

It is slightly based on the original Dockerfile by [https://github.com/jjethwa/icinga2] (Jordan Jethwa's icinga2 docker image), which is also available as a dockerhub-repository is located at [https://hub.docker.com/r/jordan/icinga2/](https://hub.docker.com/r/jordan/icinga2/).

## Image details

1. Features four containers:
   - core: the icinga2 system, plus the ssmtp facility
   - web: icingaweb2, the web-based, eye-candy gui and director
   - sql: library/mariadb (no modification, no dockerfile, just as-is)
   - snmptrap: an snmptrap system based on snmptt, snmptrapd
   
1. Based on debian:bullseye-slim (core, snmptrap) and debian:bullseye-slim (web)

1. Key-Features:
   - icinga2
   - auto-setup as a satellite or a master, you choose!
   - icingacli
   - icingaweb2
   - director + required modules
   - ssmtp
   - MariaDB
   - Supervisor
   - Apache2
   - SSL Support
   - a bunch of special plugins for monitoring ups, printer and temp sensor (via SNMP)

## Usage

Images are not (yet) available on docker hub, sorry!

However, just clone this repository, set variables in secrets.env and .env and build the image with:

    docker-compose build

then start the four containers:

    docker-compose up

et voil√†, you are set! You will find:

  - icinga2 running on port 5665;
  - icingaweb running on port 80;
  - snmptrap running on port 162

The system is meant to be run in a master-satellite setup, as described [here](https://www.icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/06-distributed-monitoring/); set the ${TYPE} variable in secrets.env to your need. If you are not interested in master-satellite setup, just set the variable to 'master'.

To remove one container (but not conf and data stored, see below!) do:

   docker-compose rm core|web|snmptrap|sql

or:

   docker-compose rm

to remove all the containers.

## Persistent volume

Directives in docker-compose.yaml create a series of named volumes, which are referred as directories in ${FIRSTNAME}/ (see below for variable reference); this ensures the portability of configuration and data through different versions of containers.

In order to work in a full clean environment, just remove the ${FIRSTNAME}/ (or just parts of it) before running new containers.

## Environment variables
The following two files are used to store variables:

	1. 
	- .env
	- secrets.env

Examples are provided via their respective -dist files. Please use those as a starting point.
The .env file is read by the docker-compose and contains the two variables:

| Variable | Description & Usage |
| ------ |------------------- |
| FIRSTNAME | name of your host |
| DOMAINNAME | name of your domain |

which, along with the $TYPE and core|snmptrap|sql|web variables, builds up the fully-qualified hostname of your container e.g., icinga2-satellite-1-core

The secrets.env is ready by containers and contains the variables employed to configure services:

| Variable | Container | Description |
| -------- |-----------|-------------|
| LOCALTIME | core, web, snmptrap | localtime e.g., Asia/Kabul |
| TYPE | core, web | type of Icinga2 container: satellite or master |
| MYSQL\_ROOT\_PASSWORD | sql, core, web | mariadb root password |
| ICINGA\_PASSWORD | sql, core | mariadb icinga2 password |
| ICINGAWEB2\_PASSWORD | sql, web | mariadb icingaweb2 password |
| ICINGA2\_USER\_FULLNAME | core | icinga2 user fullname |
| ICINGAWEB2\_ADMIN\_USER | web | icingaweb2 admin user |
| ICINGAWEB2\_ADMIN\_PASS | web | icingaweb2 admin password |
| ICINGA2\_ZONE | core | zone of your satellite. set to master if you are using a master setup |
| ICINGA2\_MASTER\_IP | core | ip of your master (satellite setup) |
| ICINGA2\_PORT | core | port of your master (satellite setup) |
| ICINGA2\_MASTER | core | FQDN of your master (satellite setup) |
| ICINGA2\_TICKET | core | ticket generated by the master for your satellite (type icinga2 pki ticket --cn yoursatellitefqdn on master) |
| DIRECTOR_DB | sql, web | DB for Director |
| DIRECTOR_USER | sql, web | DB user for Director |
| DIRECTOR_USER_PASSWORD | sql, web | DB user password for Directory |
| DIRECTOR_EP | web | Endpoint name used by Director |
| DIRECTOR_EP_USER | web | Username for endpoint name |
| DIRECTOR_EP_PASSWORD | web | Password for endpoint name |
| INFLUXDB_DB | core | Influx DB name |
| INFLUXDB_USER | core | Username to connect to Influx |
| INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD | core | Password for connecting to Influx DB |
| SMTP\_ROOT | core | user that gets the mail |
| SMTP\_MAILHOST | core | smtp server address |
| SMTP\_PORT | core | smtp server port |
| SMTP\_USER | core | smtp server user |
| SMTP\_PASS | core | smtp server password |
| SMTP\_USE\_STARTTLS | core | use starttls? yes/no |

## Update an existing system
If you already have a working Icinga2 system, just copy your config (/etc/icinga2) and certificate (/var/lib/icinga2/certs or /etc/icinga2/pki for icinga < 2.8) files in the directories listed above. The setup will automatically detect the presence of certificate files in /var/lib/icinga2/certs and will skip the configuration process.

## Icinga Web 2

Icinga Web 2 can be accessed at [http://localhost/icingaweb2](http://localhost/icingaweb2) with the credentials set in secrets.env

## Sending Notification Mails

The core container has `ssmtp` installed, which forwards mails to a preconfigured static server.

You have to create the files `ssmtp.conf` for general configuration and `revaliases` (mapping from local Unix-user to mail-address).

```
# ssmtp.conf
root=<E-Mail address to use on>
mailhub=smtp.<YOUR_MAILBOX>:587
UseSTARTTLS=YES
AuthUser=<Username for authentication (mostly the complete e-Mail-address)>
AuthPass=<YOUR_PASSWORD>
FromLineOverride=NO
```
**But be careful, ssmtp is not able to process special chars within the password correctly!**

`revaliases` follows the format: `Unix-user:e-Mail-address:server`.
Therefore the e-Mail-address has to match the `root`'s value in `ssmtp.conf`
Also server has to match mailhub from `ssmtp.conf` **but without the port**.

```
# revaliases
root:<VALUE_FROM_ROOT>:smtp.<YOUR_MAILBOX>
nagios:<VALUE_FROM_ROOT>:smtp.<YOUR_MAILBOX>
www-data:<VALUE_FROM_ROOT>:smtp.<YOUR_MAILBOX>
```

These files have to get mounted into the container. Add these flags to your `docker run`-command:
```
-v $(pwd)/revaliases:/etc/ssmtp/revaliases:ro
-v $(pwd)/ssmtp.conf:/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf:ro
```

If you want to change the display-name of sender-address, you have to define the variable `ICINGA2_USER_FULLNAME`.

If this does not work, please ask your provider for the correct mail-settings or consider the [ssmtp.conf(5)-manpage](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssmtp.conf) or Section ["Reverse Aliases" on ssmtp(8)](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ssmtp).
Also you can debug your config, by executing inside your container `ssmtp -v $address` and pressing 2x Enter.
It will send an e-Mail to `$address` and give verbose log and all error-messages.

# Adding own modules

To use your own modules, you're able to install these into `enabledModules`-folder of your `/etc/icingaweb2` volume.
